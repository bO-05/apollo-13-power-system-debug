1
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,120
Greeting Earthlings.

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,970
If you follow the channel, you know that we
are hard at work restoring the Apollo communication

3
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:19,970
hardware.

4
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:25,630
It all started simply enough, with just the
spacecraft S-Band transponder and the traveling

5
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,710
wave amplifier, that we picked up from collector
Steve Jurvetson.

6
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:36,140
But it got progressively more complete, as
we found and added more pieces to this complex

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:43,200
system, both on the spacecraft side and on
the ground side, thanks more pieces from Steve,

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,930
Marcel and other generous collectors.

9
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,829
It’s getting so involved, that we had to
add a replica of the control panel to manage

10
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:53,210
it all.

11
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,899
But we are far from done.

12
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:01,220
The system is so complex, that we still have
quite a few more boxes to restore and add.

13
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:07,050
For one, we have been powering it up with
a modern 400 Hz 3-phase AC power supply.

14
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:15,010
Now, wouldn’t it be nice, if we used the
real spacecraft power supply inverter instead.

15
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,000
[Marc]: Mike and Eric...

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
[Eric] Hello!

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,810
[Marc] ...what is this big chunk of metal
you're working on?

18
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,540
[Eric] It's very heavy!

19
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:31,250
[Mike] This is a Block I inverter.

20
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:40,780
So, one of three of these, that were installed
in the Command Module, that took in 28 volts

21
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:47,580
DC and put out 115 Volt RMS three-phase 400
Hertz AC power.

22
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,280
[Marc] The good avionics AC.

23
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,689
So one kilowatt, 1.5 kilowatt-ish each, right?

24
00:01:53,689 --> 00:02:02,670
One for each fuel cell, which was 1.3 kilowatt,
something like that.

25
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,000
To better understand the role of the inverters,
we need to look at the Apollo Command and

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,419
Service Module power system for a moment.

27
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:15,709
The heart of it consists of 3 fuel cells,
which make electricity by reacting oxygen

28
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:19,900
and hydrogen, stored in liquid cryogenic form.

29
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,870
This produces both electricity and drinkable
water.

30
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:29,011
We explained the fuel cells and their failure
on Apollo 13 in a previous episode, which

31
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:30,580
I’ll link in the doodly-doo.

32
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,390
But I’ll recap quickly here.

33
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,860
The fuel cells were quite powerful, at a max
rating of 1.42 kWatts each.

34
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:47,370
They produced the power for the whole spacecraft,
in the form of DC voltage, varying from 27V

35
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,849
to 31V, depending on how hard you ran them.

36
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:57,340
They had three fuel cells, but the whole mission
could run on only two, and, as NASA diminutively

37
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,620
puts it in their operations handbook, you
could successfully terminate a mission on

38
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,340
just one.

39
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:10,550
Of course, on Apollo 13, they lost all three,
and they were lucky to have the LM attached,

40
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,730
or the situation would not have been recoverable.

41
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:20,460
The fuel cell power was distributed over thick
conductors called busses, Main DC Bus A and

42
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:29,319
Main DC Bus B. Normally, Fuel Cell 1 powers
Main Bus A, Fuel Cell 3 powers Main Bus B,

43
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:35,760
and Fuel Cell 2 is connected to either A,
B or both, as a backup.

44
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,200
And that’s why you hear the famous Main
B Bus undervolt call on Apollo 13.

45
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,430
[Apollo 13 Audio]
LOVELL: Hey Houston, we've had a problem

46
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,010
CAPCOM: OK
HOUSTON: Standby, they've got a problem

47
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,540
LOVELL: We have a Main B Bus undervolt

48
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,569
They had just lost Fuel Cell 1 and 3.

49
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:58,680
At the Apollo 13 accident time, the backup
Fuel Cell 2 was connected to Bus A, so only

50
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,530
the Bus B voltage went to zero, hence the
Main Bus B Undervolt caution light.

51
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:10,269
However, you can manually switch any fuel
cell to any bus, and you hear them at first

52
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:16,440
try to reconnect fuel cells to the default
configuration, cell 1 on bus A, and cell 3

53
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,470
on bus B.

54
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,320
EECOM: Flight Eecom
FLIGHT: Go ahead

55
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,039
EECOM: He's got fuel cells 1 and 3 are offline.

56
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:29,380
We got main A volts, we have no main B volts.

57
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,370
Have him attempt to reconnect the fuel cells.

58
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:38,380
Fuel cell 1 to Main A, fuel cell 3 to Main
B. Just try that.

59
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:45,870
CAPCOM: 13 Houston, we'd like you to attempt
to reconnect fuel cell 1 to Main A, and fuel

60
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,289
cell 3 to Main B.

61
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:53,451
This will of course fail, as both fuel cells
are already gone, and the remaining fuel cell

62
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:58,610
2 will be nursed to last an agonizing 90 more
minutes before being shut down

63
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,710
HAISE: OK, Houston, I'm showing...

64
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:07,440
I tried to reset and fuel cell 1 and 3 are
both showing grey flags, but they are both

65
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,590
showing zip on the flows.

66
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,870
EECOM: I copy Flight
CAPCOM: We copy

67
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:19,630
EECOM: Let me commiserate on that

68
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:26,660
Note that on this drawing from Apollo 17,
Fuel Cell 2 has a big 400 amp/hour battery

69
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,660
backup.

70
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,230
Couldn’t they just switch that on?

71
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,230
Well, you bet they did not have that one on
Apollo 13.

72
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,230
It was added on 14 after the accident.

73
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,230
Hindsight is always 20/20, as they say.

74
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,230
Note that on this drawing from Apollo 17,
Fuel Cell 2 has a big 400 amp hour battery

75
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,230
backup.

76
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,230
Couldn’t they just switch that on?

77
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,230
Well, you bet they did not have that one on
Apollo 13.

78
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,950
It was added on 14 after the accident.

79
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,819
Hindsight is always 20/20, as they say.

80
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:43,570
But enough for the DC power.

81
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,319
What we want to discuss AC power.

82
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:52,139
The spacecraft had two AC busses, powered
by 3 inverters, one of which we are about

83
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:53,780
to open.

84
00:05:53,780 --> 00:06:00,120
The inverters converted the DC power from
the fuel cells to AC power, namely 115 Volts,

85
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:07,630
400 Hz, 3 phase AC, which had been the standard
for aircraft AC for over half a century.

86
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:13,190
The inverters were quite beefy, rated at 1.25
kWatts each.

87
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:18,070
Since we have 3 fuel cells and 3 inverters,
you’d think one inverter would be assigned

88
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:23,150
to each fuel cell, but the system is more
flexible than that.

89
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:29,770
As you can see here, inverter 1 is powered
by Main Bus A, Inverter 2 by Main Bus B, and

90
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,169
Inverter 3 by either Main A or Main B.

91
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:39,190
Each inverter AC output can be connected to
two busses, AC 1 or AC 2.

92
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:46,500
In the normal config , Inverter 1 powers AC
1, Inverter 2 powers AC 2, and Inverter 3

93
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,720
is on standby, connected to nothing.

94
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,840
Note that unlike the fuel cells, which you
could pile up on the same DC bus, you cannot

95
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,699
connect two inverters at the same time to
the same AC bus, because of phase issues.

96
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:07,350
However, there was flexibility to connect
any inverter to any AC bus if needed.

97
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:13,530
A complicated set of motorized relays implemented
automatic interlocks, preventing to connect

98
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:17,740
more than one inverter at a time to the same
AC bus.

99
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:23,080
So, you should now be able understand why
they lost AC 2 on Apollo 13.

100
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,790
Main DC Bus B went down, and that’s the
one that powers inverter 2.

101
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:35,190
So inverter 2 went down, and that took out
AC Bus 2, taking with it the telemetry sensors

102
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,919
that were connected to it.

103
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,340
Sensors that will become quite important pretty
soon.

104
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,740
You can hear them realizing that, early in
the debug.

105
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,389
EECOM: It does appear we've lost AC Bus 2
voltage.

106
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:59,160
Main B is reading 4 Volts, and that effectively
takes AC 2 away from us.

107
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,919
By the way, that was the voice of our engineering
hero Sy Liebergot, manning the EECOM console

108
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,500
at the time of the accident.

109
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,629
EECOM stands for Electrical, environmental
and consumables.

110
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:17,319
The EECOM will get quite a workout during
Apollo 13, and get everything just about right

111
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:20,430
in a very confusing situation.

112
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:25,580
About 10 minutes after the accident, way before
it will all get confirmed, EECOM reluctantly

113
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,940
comes to the conclusion that they have lost
a large amount of pressure in oxygen tank

114
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:35,149
1, lost fuel cell 1 and 3, and that they blew
a sphere, which is one of their pressurized

115
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:36,149
tanks.

116
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:41,091
EPS: We might have a pressure problem in the
fuel cell, it looks like

117
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:42,913
EECOM: Yeah
EPS: Seemed to happen simultaneously

118
00:08:42,913 --> 00:08:45,694
EECOM: That can't be!

119
00:08:45,694 --> 00:08:50,914
EPS: I can't believe that right off the bat,
but they are not feeding current

120
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:01,800
EECOM: Yeah, if you believe that N2 pressure
we blew a sphere!

121
00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:11,420
EPS: Yeah, we might have lost fuel cell 1,
and it looks like fuel cell 3 is gone too! 

122
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,920
The other voice you just heard is from our
behind the scene hero number two, Dick Brown,

123
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,579
manning the EPS, the Electricity Power System
officer, in the back room.

124
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:26,290
Sy will heavily rely on Dick for the whole
debug.

125
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:31,839
In the meantime, Sy passes on the bad news
to ECS, the Environmental Control Systems

126
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:32,839
engineer.

127
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,877
EECOM: And ECS Eecom
ECS: Go ahead

128
00:09:35,877 --> 00:09:40,720
EECOM: Larry, I am almost afraid to think
that we lost our O2 tank 1,

129
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,490
or we busted the manifold or something.

130
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,070
Why, that pressure shouldn't be down that
far.

131
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:51,570
So, right now, the only remaining source of
power is fuel cell number 2, powered by the

132
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,580
dwindling pressure in Oxygen Tank 1.

133
00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:01,459
About 16 minutes in, EPS asks for an immediate
reduction of the power consumption, once again

134
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:02,459
the correct move.

135
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:05,234
EPS: Eecom this is EPS
EECOM: Go

136
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:08,316
EPS: I think we ought to start powering down
EECOM: Yeah

137
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,908
EPS: Can we...

138
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:12,419
let's keep the power down

139
00:10:15,071 --> 00:10:18,425
FLIGHT: Eecom do you want to go through that again, what do you want to power down to?

140
00:10:18,425 --> 00:10:21,621
EECOM: I want to power down a total of 10A,
Flight

141
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,911
FLIGHT: A total of 10A!?

142
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:25,423
EECOM: That's affirm
FLIGHT: Okay

143
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:30,779
After that first emergency power down, which
takes a while to figure out, we are about

144
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,730
25 minutes in.

145
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,490
Sy shifts his focus to confirming the status
of Oxygen Tank 2.

146
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:44,540
O2 Tank 2 would be their only hope to power
Fuel Cell 2, if tank 1 keeps leaking out.

147
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,350
But remember our off-line inverter 3 and our
dead AC Bus 2?

148
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:54,830
Well, Sy has not been able read the O2 Tank
2 pressure since the accident, because the

149
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,680
pressure sensor is powered by the now dead
AC Bus 2.

150
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,960
He then asks Gene Kranz to prioritize the
re-powering of AC bus 2, so he can check on

151
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,019
O2 Tank 2.

152
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:09,843
EECOM: Hey EPS Eecom
EPS: Go

153
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:13,950
EECOM: We gotta get inverter... we gotta get
AC2 back temporarily so we can see what's

154
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,400
going on with the O2 pressures!

155
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,020
O2 Tank 2 pressure.

156
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:20,352
EECOM: Flight Eecom
FLIGHT: Go Eecom

157
00:11:20,352 --> 00:11:21,850
EECOM: Okay I need one thing right now.

158
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,519
He's powering down, he's down to 41 amps total
spacecraft.

159
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,940
I'd like to get my AC 2 bus back, so I can
look at O2 Tank 2 pressure.

160
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,830
I have had no insight into that.

161
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,830
FLIGHT: Okay.

162
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:42,866
EECOM: Let's get, uh, I guess we can put the
inverter 3 to Main A - AC2

163
00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:48,480
Inverter 3 is indeed the only other inverter
that be configured to be powered by Main A,

164
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,410
and can be connected to the AC 2 bus.

165
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,770
But this will not get done, because Gene pushes
back.

166
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:59,579
He is still in power reduction mode, and worried
about creating additional problems.

167
00:12:01,244 --> 00:12:03,443
EECOM: Let's just do it temporarily
FLIGHT: Let me ask you a question.

168
00:12:03,443 --> 00:12:06,295
Before you do that, would you like to make
sure you got all AC loads you don't need isolated

169
00:12:06,295 --> 00:12:08,734
from the bus?

170
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:13,387
EECOM: No, let's not do that right now Flight.

171
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:17,140
I think we're in good shape that way, main
A is up high enough where it can handle the

172
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,529
inverter
FLIGHT: A thing that concerns me, is throwing

173
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:24,510
equipment - we had a problem, we don't know
the cause of the problem

174
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:29,709
That’s when Sy, who had suspected that Fuel
Cell 1 and 3 were gone from the very first

175
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:35,310
minutes after the accident, finally breaks
the bad news to Gene Kranz for the first time.

176
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,880
It’s about 20 minutes in.

177
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,380
EECOM: Flight I've got a feeling we've lost
two fuel cells.

178
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,970
I hate to put it that way but...

179
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,180
I don't know why we've lost them.

180
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,279
It doesn't all tag up.

181
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,320
And it's not an instrumentation problem, to
the best I can tell right now.

182
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,940
FLIGHT: Okay, I'll tell you what, let's discuss
this for just a little bit longer there, Sy.

183
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,660
Capcom start moving them back towards the
PTC attitude.

184
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,640
Gene is still reluctant.

185
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,589
You have to realize that he is on the flight
loop.

186
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:10,470
He has heard nothing of the backroom conversations
between EECOM and EPS like we have done here,

187
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,530
on this after the fact composite loop.

188
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:17,339
All he’s heard so far, were the various
recommendations by EECOM to switch things

189
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:20,839
around while reducing power draw.

190
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:23,410
Then Dick Brown has a brainwave.

191
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:29,810
He realizes that, although you cannot put
two inverters on one AC bus, you *can* put

192
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:33,980
one inverter on two AC busses.

193
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,949
Inverter 1 is working fine right now, powered
from the still good Main A. That will also

194
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:42,829
save the power draw of bringing up another
inverter.

195
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:45,230
EPS: Hey Sy? EECOM: Go ahead 

196
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,190
 
EPS: Why don't you put one inverter on both busses

197
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,940
It will save about 4A.

198
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:55,629
We can try AC inverter 1 on both AC busses.

199
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:58,076
EECOM: You want inverter 1 on both AC busses?

200
00:13:58,076 --> 00:13:59,076
EPS: Right
EECOM: Okay

201
00:14:02,034 --> 00:14:03,436
EECOM: Flight Eecom
FLIGHT: Go Eecom

202
00:14:03,436 --> 00:14:04,880
EECOM: I got a little correction.

203
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,760
Let's put inverter 1 on both AC busses, please
FLIGHT: Inverter 1 on both AC?

204
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,203
EECOM: That's affirm.

205
00:14:11,203 --> 00:14:14,790
Gene is still nervous about the move and asks
a second time.

206
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:20,705
FLIGHT: OK, so, you want to configure inverter
1 on both AC busses?

207
00:14:20,705 --> 00:14:22,361
EECOM: That's affirm, Flight

208
00:14:24,224 --> 00:14:27,470
You can tell he's still worried about making
a blunder.

209
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:33,329
He asks a third time for himself, then fully
commits to it and gives the go-ahead.

210
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:36,209
What they are about to discover is startling.

211
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:39,982
FLIGHT: You want to put inverter one in both
AC busses?

212
00:14:39,982 --> 00:14:41,837
Eecom and Capcom let's do it.

213
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:43,363
CAPCOM: Okay.

214
00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:46,765
CAPCOM: 13 Houston, we need to get some more
instrumentation up.

215
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:49,457
We'd like you to put inverter 1 on both AC
buses, over.

216
00:14:49,457 --> 00:14:50,709
FLIGHT: Eecom Flight
EECOM: Flight Eecom

217
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:52,450
FLIGHT: Monitor this bird when we switch it
in

218
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,982
EECOM: Will do
SWIGERT: Okay

219
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:02,639
This segment it hard to hear, but behind the
chatter, you can hear the answer from the

220
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,639
pressure reading.

221
00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:09,295
ECS: Hey Bill O2 Tank 2 pressure.

222
00:15:10,128 --> 00:15:11,884
OK, it's low, it's been low.

223
00:15:11,884 --> 00:15:15,294
It looks like the culprit is probably venting.

224
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:19,255
In fact, it's probably the one that blew up
if anything it caused... it caused the problem.

225
00:15:19,255 --> 00:15:22,515
EPS: Okay I see 19 PSI
ECS: Right

226
00:15:22,646 --> 00:15:25,399
It’s 19 PSI.

227
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,290
It should be 900, not 19.

228
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:33,500
The second oxygen tank that they were counting
on is no more.

229
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,360
That’s the one that caused the problem in
the first place.

230
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,920
Gene is eager to find out, if his caving in
for the request was worth it.

231
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,930
And Sy is so taken aback by the reading, that
he asks for some time to take it all in.

232
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,810
FLIGHT: Okay, you got two good AC busses.

233
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:49,810
What did all that tell you now?

234
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:57,149
EECOM: It... it tells me... that, uh... well...
just give me about two more minutes, Flight

235
00:15:57,149 --> 00:15:59,920
FLIGHT: Okay, take your time

236
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,779
Sy thinks the tank 2 is simply empty.

237
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:04,870
One way to confirm it is by looking at the
temperature.

238
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:08,130
EECOM: Trying to figure out what happened
to that O2 tank 2.

239
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,130
EPS: Right.

240
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,880
Now our pressure still should be good.

241
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,940
And you see, we got a low point...
EECOM: Why did the temperature drop so suddenly?

242
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,730
EPS: Because I probably don't have anything
left in it!

243
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,730
EECOM: Yeah!

244
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,269
And we're losing tank 1, if we can believe
it.

245
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:25,779
EPS: Uh, losing what?

246
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:27,300
EECOM: Tank 1 pressure!

247
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,300
EPS: Yeah!

248
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,269
EECOM: Do you think we blew the manifold?

249
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:37,940
EPS: It looks pretty good that we blew it
between the check valve and O2 tank 2!

250
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,389
Oh yes, they sure did blow the manifold, and
then much more.

251
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:44,920
They blew the whole tank.

252
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,279
Sy will never bother to answer Gene’s question.

253
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:50,940
He has already moved to the next step.

254
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,800
Tank 2 is a goner.

255
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:58,769
Instead, he immediately focuses on a few more
attempts to save what’s left on tank 1.

256
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:04,449
EPS asks that they try to turn on the heater
in tank 1, to see if the pressure will come

257
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:05,449
back up.

258
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:09,230
Tank 1 is now around 320 psi and dropping.

259
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,206
They need to beg for 5 Amps of power to turn
the heater on.

260
00:17:14,126 --> 00:17:19,070
FLIGHT: Capcom, we want to get cryo O2 tank
number 1 heater on

261
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:25,116
CAPCOM: Roger, copy that, and we'd like to
build up the pressure in the O2 tank 1.

262
00:17:25,117 --> 00:17:30,000
So turn the heaters on manually, we'll watch
the pressure for you

263
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,101
EECOM: Okay, 26.9V

264
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:34,153
FLIGHT: Did you see a 5A increase coming through Eecom?

265
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,513
EECOM: Do you see 5A increase here Dick?

266
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,320
EPS: That's affirm
EECOM: That's affirm, Flight

267
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,970
FLIGHT: Okay
EECOM: 26.7V, looks good.

268
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,866
We'll watch the pressure.

269
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:46,560
OK, this better works, or our Fuel Cell 3
will lose its oxygen supply.

270
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,910
How does the pressure look, Sy?

271
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,809
EECOM: ECS Eecom
EPS: Go!

272
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:53,039
EECOM: It looks grim!

273
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,627
EPS: Yes it does
EECOM: Get the 5A and no pressure increase

274
00:17:56,627 --> 00:17:59,277
EPS: Just went down!

275
00:17:59,277 --> 00:18:02,040
EECOM: It's going down, we're losing it!

276
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,594
EPS: Yes we are.

277
00:18:03,594 --> 00:18:06,610
We are in serious problem if we can't get
any pressure, then we've got to power down

278
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,158
some more here
EECOM: That's right.

279
00:18:08,158 --> 00:18:13,191
And luckily we've got the LM
EPS: Yeah but that's not gonna help this fuel cell

280
00:18:13,191 --> 00:18:15,135
EECOM: That's right, we're gonna get it all

281
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,570
the way down
EPS: If we can't save that pressure, we're

282
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,730
gonna lose this third fuel cell
EECOM: Rog

283
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,390
Sy has realized it’s an abandon ship situation.

284
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:29,250
He tells flight to get the crew in the LM,
and admonishes his peer for the LM, called

285
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,460
the TELMU, to better get ready for an emergency
power up procedure.

286
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,980
EECOM: Flight Eecom
FLIGHT: Go ahead Eecom

287
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,049
EECOM: The pressure in O2 tank 1 is all the
way down at 297.

288
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:43,309
You better think about getting in the LM,
or using the LM systems.

289
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:46,330
TELMU: Go ahead Eecom
EECOM: Now let me tell you, we're in danger

290
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,970
of losing all three fuel cells.

291
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,482
So you guys get yourself geared up, okay?

292
00:18:50,482 --> 00:18:51,482
TELMU: Rog we are working on right this minute...

293
00:18:51,482 --> 00:18:52,942
EECOM: Get your power procedure now.

294
00:18:52,942 --> 00:18:54,738
You guys had one worked out already, I think,
didn't you?

295
00:18:54,738 --> 00:18:56,280
TELMU: That's right
EECOM: Okay

296
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,460
It’s about 40 minutes after the accident.

297
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:05,021
Sy has only one question for EPS now: how
long do we have to bring the LM up, before

298
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:07,630
running out of power in the command module?

299
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,030
EPS: Eecom?

300
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:13,212
EECOM: Go
EPS: Sy, looks like from the leak rate, that

301
00:19:13,212 --> 00:19:19,661
we've got about 1 hour and 54 minutes left
until we are down to 100 PSI in tank 1.

302
00:19:19,661 --> 00:19:25,026
Which is about the end of it for the fuel
cell

303
00:19:25,026 --> 00:19:29,710
EECOM: Uh, Flight, we are gonna hit 100 PSI
in an hour 54 minutes.

304
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:34,100
That's the end, right there.

305
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,940
From there on, it’s a mad rush for an emergency
power up of the LM and a semi-graceful power

306
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,000
down of the CM.

307
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,220
But there will not be quite enough time before
Fuel Cell 2 conks out.

308
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,840
Which brings us to the subject of the battery
system.

309
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:54,030
So we are back in DC land, and there are a
few more busses we have not talked about yet,

310
00:19:54,030 --> 00:20:00,190
in particular battery Bus A and battery Bus
B. On Apollo 13, which was lacking the big

311
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:06,640
service module battery backup added later,
these were powered by three small silver batteries,

312
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,720
at a measly 40 amp hour each.

313
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,460
These were only meant for powering the Command
Module during the short re-entry.

314
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,200
There a was provision to throw the batteries
on the Main DC busses, to cover for a usage

315
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,510
spike.

316
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:25,900
This was done by connecting, or tying, the
busses together, once again using a series

317
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,630
of motorized relays.

318
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:33,520
A few minutes into the accident, the ground
asks the astronauts to turn on the A/C bus

319
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:40,100
Tie, which will tie Battery Bus A with Main
A. Since only Battery A was on the Battery

320
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:47,309
Bus A, with backup Battery C on standby, this
action connected Battery A to Main A, to help

321
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:49,110
out the struggling fuel cell 2.

322
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,880
EECOM: Stand by, Flight.

323
00:20:50,902 --> 00:20:55,277
Go EPS
EPS: Let's throw a battery on Bus B and Bus A

324
00:20:55,277 --> 00:20:56,277
EECOM: Okay

325
00:20:56,277 --> 00:20:57,731
EPS: Until we are sorted out.

326
00:20:57,731 --> 00:20:58,716
We're getting undervolt.

327
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,091
EECOM: Flight, Eecom
FLIGHT: Go ahead Eecom

328
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:00,930
EECOM: Okay.

329
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,536
If we want to keep main...

330
00:21:03,536 --> 00:21:05,590
SWIGERT: Houston, are you still reading 13?

331
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,779
EECOM: Stand by, he's finishing...

332
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:10,064
CAPCOM: Affirmative, we are reading you
EECOM: ...get battery A on Main A. Let's get

333
00:21:10,064 --> 00:21:12,666
battery A on main A now

334
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,208
HAISE: OK Bus Tie A/C on

335
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:20,600
But as the situation gets worse, Houston needs
to save the re-entry batteries, and tells

336
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,990
the crew to take the tie off.

337
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:28,480
The astronauts immediately know why, realizing
full well the consequences of having used

338
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,730
part of their re-entry battery for the better
of 30 minutes.

339
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,770
EECOM: Flight, Eecom
FLIGHT: Go Eecom

340
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:41,194
EECOM: We really gotta get that battery off
the line and power down some more

341
00:21:41,194 --> 00:21:46,516
FLIGHT: OK Sy, now how long to you want to
leave this battery online?

342
00:21:46,516 --> 00:21:49,685
EECOM: I want to try to get it off as quick
as I can, but I need to get powered down.

343
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:52,245
EECOM: You want that battery off the line
now?

344
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:53,113
EPS: Yeah.

345
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:56,239
We can take it off now
EECOM: Okay.

346
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:57,721
Flight Eecom
FLIGHT: Go Eecom

347
00:21:57,721 --> 00:22:01,219
EECOM: Let's take battery A off the main
FLIGHT: We can support the...

348
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:03,578
EECOM: That's right
FLIGHT: ...right now on the one fuel cell

349
00:22:03,578 --> 00:22:05,739
even with the cry 2 going down?

350
00:22:05,739 --> 00:22:07,900
EECOM: That's affirm, Flight
FLIGHT: OK.

351
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,793
What's your worry level on cry O2?

352
00:22:11,793 --> 00:22:13,166
EECOM: Say again, Flight?

353
00:22:13,188 --> 00:22:14,561
FLIGHT: OK, you want to...

354
00:22:14,561 --> 00:22:17,478
EECOM: I want to save the battery, Flight
FLIGHT: Okay.

355
00:22:17,478 --> 00:22:25,264
Pulling the battery A off, Capcom
CAPCOM: 13 Houston, turn the battery A off

356
00:22:25,264 --> 00:22:28,538
SWIGERT: That's right, we were pulling current
all the time!

357
00:22:28,538 --> 00:22:31,080
LOVELL: Battery A off, roger

358
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,720
However, an hour later, at the tail end of
the CM to LM transfer, Fuel Cell 2 is not

359
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,130
going to make it, and they desperately need
to keep the Command Module computer and the inertial

360
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:48,600
platform going, until they are able to transfer
inertial platform attitude angles to the LM.

361
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,120
They are now caught between a rock and hard
place.

362
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,090
Flight director Glynn Lunney decides, rightly,
to prioritize the transfer of the inertial

363
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,549
platform over saving the batteries.

364
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:04,520
They had just started to recharge battery
A. Glynn reverses that decision promptly.

365
00:23:05,638 --> 00:23:06,638
FLIGHT: Capcom, Flight
CAPCOM: Go ahead

366
00:23:06,638 --> 00:23:10,355
FLIGHT: When we get a little low, we are going
to have them pull batt A off (recharge), and

367
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:13,002
we get them put it on Main Bus A.

368
00:23:13,002 --> 00:23:17,508
We are then going to hold up the IMU long
enough to get a coarse align in the LM.

369
00:23:17,508 --> 00:23:19,779
And then we'll see whether we are going to
keep that coarse align or not.

370
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:23,168
But for right now we are running the profile,
then we'll have to determine it.

371
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:27,290
And keeping the coarse align they will, this
was a mission saving decision.

372
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:32,810
They will do a free return trajectory burn
a few hours later, and will not even have

373
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:39,429
to attempt a platform star alignment for the
precision abort burn at PC+2 after going around

374
00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:40,630
the Moon.

375
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:45,279
After that, they’ll finally turn the LM
inertial platform and the computer off, to

376
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,169
save LM power.

377
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:50,420
Now, they are still not out of the woods in
terms of power.

378
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:54,710
They need to recharge their reentry battery
A that had saved them earlier.

379
00:23:54,710 --> 00:24:00,809
They will do it, thanks to a cable meant to
recharge the LM batteries from the CM, and

380
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:05,419
a hacked procedure to use it in reverse, involving
100’s of circuit breakers.

381
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:12,870
[John Aaron, EECOM] There was a normal process
when you go into the moon, and coasting to

382
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:18,610
the Moon, that the command module supplied
a little electrical power to the lunar module.

383
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:25,070
What you could do through a precarious route,
is figure out some way to have that power

384
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,870
transfer come backwards.

385
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:31,520
Somehow we could arrange the circuitry, such
that the only thing that you would be powering

386
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,980
inside the Command Module, out of all the
hundreds and thousands of switches and circuit

387
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,240
breakers, was just this little thing called
a battery charger.

388
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,130
And we sent the crew over this checklist,
and they couldn't believe that we had devised

389
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:46,030
this little multi-page checklist, with hundreds
of circuit breakers and switches and all that

390
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,780
on it, to actually get to the battery charger.

391
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,780
But it worked!

392
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:56,590
[Marc] Alright, you are now Apollo spacecraft
power system experts, and should be able to

393
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:03,049
follow the raw Apollo 13 accident audio, which
is the best 2-1/2 hour customer service support

394
00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:04,789
call you’ll ever hear.

395
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:07,559
I’ll link it in the doodly-doo.

396
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:11,610
But let’s get back to opening our inverter,
which was supposed to be the focus of the

397
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,610
video.

398
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:15,220
I know, we got sidetracked a bit…

399
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,550
[Marc] And this one, you identified?

400
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:23,670
[Mike] Yeah, it has written on the side here:
"B/P 14 use only".

401
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:33,830
B/P 14, boilerplate 14, was the North American
house spacecraft.

402
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:40,720
So this was the spacecraft that they had in
their Downey plant, that they did essentially

403
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,200
all their integration testing on.

404
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,150
Block 2 is very similar from the specification
control drawings we got.

405
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:56,310
It looks like they may have combined all of
these studs into circular connectors for Block 2.

406
00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:00,940
You can see, it was laying on the floor of
the capsule, it has the angle.

407
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,779
So, laying upside down.

408
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:08,870
The three inverters were wedged under the
communications equipment, and had to conform

409
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,809
to the curved edge of the heat shield, laying
upside down.

410
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:17,740
And somebody apparently had that in his aircraft
or something.

411
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:24,440
And they had put goop on it, and there were
some stuff that is not original.

412
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
We cleaned it up.

413
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,029
So it sat on a hot plate - on a hot plate
- on a cold plate over here!

414
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:34,410
Which has a leak in it, it has a patch on
the other side.

415
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:43,299
And there is this really heavy copperish material,
that's supposed to be in between the two.

416
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:49,600
But somebody had added some goop on it, which
shouldn't be, of course, in a spaceship.

417
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,360
So we removed it as best as we could.

418
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,779
So, this one has seen some amateur use.

419
00:26:55,779 --> 00:27:00,840
But it's a cool thing to have in your aircraft!

420
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,960
Yeah, we don't know what's in there.

421
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:09,084
There was a screw missing, there's some stuff
that doesn't belong.

422
00:27:09,084 --> 00:27:12,490
So we're going to look at this stuff in there.

423
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,309
Right away there was something cheesy with
that unit.

424
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:20,460
Screws were missing, nuts were heard falling
inside, and we spied some strange looking

425
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,460
material.

426
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:27,929
So we took the Depstek endoscope, and got
greeted by strange stuff that did not look

427
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:28,929
quite right.

428
00:27:28,929 --> 00:27:30,029
[Marc] A mouse!

429
00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:32,980
[Eric] Almost looks like it, but it's not.

430
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,470
[Marc] So it doesn't look pretty inside.

431
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,490
I'm not sure if it's asbestos-y.

432
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,570
Why would you put that in there?

433
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:46,680
From then on, our voices will be a bit muffled,
because we all put on N95 masks.

434
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,030
And it turned out to be a good decision.

435
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:53,320
The screws or whatever was welded at the bottom,
just..

436
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,400
some of them went loose.

437
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,970
So this has had a tough life.

438
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:01,960
That's the weirdest piece of Apollo equipment
we ever opened up.

439
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,409
It's filled with this crap.

440
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:09,440
That would be an insulator.

441
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,840
It's very very light.

442
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,029
Yeah, I think you're right, it's - how do
you call it?

443
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:16,029
[Eric] Vermiculite.

444
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:17,029
[Mike] Yeah.

445
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:21,270
[Marc] Oh no, someone filled the thing with
vermiculite.

446
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:25,769
This was a test unit, so it was not potted,
and therefore you were not supposed to fly

447
00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:26,769
it.

448
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:31,390
So probably the person that used it in his
airplane thought it would be a brilliant idea

449
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,840
to pot it with vermiculite.

450
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,770
Which is very light and insulating.

451
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:41,720
In fact, being an incredibly good thermal
insulator, it is just about the last thing

452
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,690
you’d want to fill a power supply with.

453
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,409
And to top it off, it’s extremely toxic.

454
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:52,289
Vermiculite is laced with the most deadly
form of asbestos.

455
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:57,424
Good thing we put our N95 masks on, but we
might still have gotten some of it.

456
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:08,990
Okay, so we're back at the inverter, the deadly
asbestos contaminated inverter.

457
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:13,280
Should be fairly clean, but we masked up just
in case.

458
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:19,520
Well, should be fairly clean, I'm sure there's
tons of particles coming out of it still.

459
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,080
It's a little sketch.

460
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:30,789
So you see, this is the 28 volt input, and
it's yay far from the from the heatsink or

461
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:33,460
the holder of that cap over here.

462
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,488
This is very tight.

463
00:29:36,488 --> 00:29:45,500
There's another point you can see over here
that is super tight.

464
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,200
I saw another one that...

465
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,310
Yeah, I bent that one up, because it was so
close, I put it up.

466
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:58,760
So it's a little sketch, you have three of
the same thing here.

467
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,150
These guys are actually not transistors, they
are diodes.

468
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:07,200
They only have two connections to it, this
one is left floating, and this is true for

469
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:14,550
a lot of them, so that's on purpose.

470
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:18,150
We will have a lot of capacitors to check.

471
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,730
Plenty plenty plenty plenty plenty.

472
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:25,510
100 micro.

473
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:30,320
Lots of caps on this side.

474
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,649
Oh that's an SCR.

475
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:40,049
That is the main inverter.

476
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:41,790
Lots of transformers of course.

477
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:44,169
There's a huge one in the middle.

478
00:30:44,169 --> 00:30:50,049
Underneath here, I think, that's a big transformer.

479
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:52,980
Some more out here.

480
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:57,050
A bit of a scary monster, that is.

481
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:01,529
We cleaned it off the best we could, but this
unit is just too contaminated for us to work

482
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:02,720
on it.

483
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,160
To make things worse, there were obvious signs
of corrosion.

484
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,000
We don’t have the schematics, but we have
a good block diagram and a short description

485
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
of how it works.

486
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:20,669
It’s all solid state, they use thyristors,
or SCRs, a buck converter, and magnetic amplifiers.

487
00:31:20,669 --> 00:31:25,980
The final upvoltage conversion is done by
rotating magnetic fields in a specially wound

488
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:33,919
transformer to create an efficient power unit,
although very heavy due all the magnetics.

489
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,559
We went as far as testing a few capacitors.

490
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,429
We can’t really work on repairing this unit,
since it’s too contaminated.

491
00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:45,130
One bad capacitor, and that would be the end
of it.

492
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:52,070
[Marc] Testing the caps in circuit, I guess,
will be the only thing we can do.

493
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,690
[Mike] Yeah.

494
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:58,820
[Marc] I bent it up because this was like
a fraction of a millimeter.

495
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,850
[Mike] Man, Block 1!

496
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:07,184
[Marc] So, my idea was just, check a few caps.

497
00:32:07,184 --> 00:32:09,351
3.8 microfarad!

498
00:32:09,351 --> 00:32:12,499
That starts good.

499
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:14,720
3.8, okay.

500
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,980
12 microfarad, so that looks okay.

501
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:27,729
100 microfarads, 92 microfarads, well that's
pretty good I would say.

502
00:32:27,729 --> 00:32:30,000
550 microfarad!

503
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,820
What's up?

504
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,050
Some with too much capacitance?

505
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:38,982
Should we complain about it?

506
00:32:38,982 --> 00:32:46,160
47, well they're all reasonably capacitive.

507
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,279
[Mike] hmm-hm.

508
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:51,667
[Marc] 34, 36, and 35.

509
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:56,376
So man, looks reasonable to me.

510
00:32:56,376 --> 00:33:02,771
Okay, so the ones that are spot checkable,
check okay.

511
00:33:02,771 --> 00:33:04,109
Over here, some over there.

512
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:06,000
It's full of caps basically.

513
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
[Mike] Yes.

514
00:33:07,872 --> 00:33:10,950
[Marc] 2.5 microfarads on the dot.

515
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:16,259
[Mike] Yeah, 60 MFD.

516
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:24,904
[Marc] This big fellow reads 2.5 micro, but
it's written 68 on it. Hmm.

517
00:33:24,904 --> 00:33:29,220
So I got the end out of it, so we can test
it out of circuit.

518
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:36,000
6 - no, 65 nanofarads.

519
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:39,523
Oh that's bad.

520
00:33:39,808 --> 00:33:43,799
This one looks like it's a capacitor no more.

521
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:54,170
Yeah, so, the 1.8 microfarad is from the connection
it's attached to, and this one is not a capacitor anymore.

522
00:33:54,170 --> 00:34:00,059
Okay, so, we have one bad one.

523
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:03,819
Which probably tells us, we just give up.

524
00:34:03,819 --> 00:34:05,579
[Mike] Yep.

525
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:09,020
[Marc] 659 nanofarad.

526
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:18,830
So we have one example of one that died, which
is one too many, right?

527
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:23,382
They are so many capacitors all over the place.

528
00:34:23,382 --> 00:34:24,992
[Mike] Yeah.

529
00:34:24,993 --> 00:34:27,712
[Marc] We pack it all back together.

530
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,712
[Mike] Return to sender!

531
00:34:28,712 --> 00:34:29,712
[Marc] We send it back.

532
00:34:29,712 --> 00:34:36,935
Oh dang, I would have wanted to give it a
try, but it's not in working order.

533
00:34:36,935 --> 00:34:41,985
[Mike] I'd be really curious to see what a
Block 2 inverter looks like on the inside,

534
00:34:41,985 --> 00:34:44,959
considering they didn't change the part number.

535
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,179
They changed the dash number, but not the
part number.

536
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:51,119
[Marc] I'm being nice to the next owner of
this.

537
00:34:51,996 --> 00:34:55,056
I'm making sure I put some tape.

538
00:34:55,056 --> 00:34:56,874
It's cloth tape.

539
00:34:56,875 --> 00:35:01,320
It's period correct, from teletype, it's just
the wrong color.

540
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:07,599
And places where there was stuff that could
be come in contact with the top cover.

541
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,222
And our dodgy one behind the 28 volt input.

542
00:35:11,222 --> 00:35:17,180
So if somebody tries to fire it up, at least
you won't have these short circuits.

543
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:26,200
So it's all buttoned up, and Eric, who did
the bottom part of the cold plate, is reassembling it.

544
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:32,580
But that's it, bye bye inverter, I don't think
we'll power it up.

545
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:37,240
So we sealed it up in plastic bags and will
not touch it again, and had to take few days

546
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,670
off to wash every surface in the lab.

547
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:45,730
At least it taught us a bit about the command
module power system, and the incredible adventure

548
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,290
of Apollo 13.

549
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:52,410
So, don’t use collectible Apollo inverters
in your aircrafts, unless you have a team

550
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:59,215
of crack ground controllers to get your back,
and see you in the next episode!
