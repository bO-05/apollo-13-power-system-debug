# The Apollo 13 Accident

The Apollo 13 mission, launched on April 11, 1970, was intended to be the third lunar landing mission. However, approximately 56 hours into the flight, a catastrophic event occurred that forced the mission to be aborted and the crew to fight for their survival.

The accident was caused by a short circuit in the wiring of one of the spacecraft's oxygen tanks, leading to an explosion that damaged the Service Module and resulted in a loss of power and oxygen. This event set in motion a series of critical decisions and actions by the mission control team to bring the astronauts safely back to Earth.

The key events of the Apollo 13 accident can be summarized as follows:

<Steps>

### Step 1: Oxygen Tank Explosion

At approximately 55 hours and 54 minutes into the mission, the crew heard a loud bang and felt a vibration. Mission Commander Jim Lovell famously reported, "Houston, we've had a problem." The problem was traced back to an explosion in oxygen tank 2, which had been damaged during a routine stirring procedure.

### Step 2: Loss of Fuel Cells and AC Bus 2

The explosion caused a loss of oxygen and power, as [Fuel Cell 1 and Fuel Cell 3](/command-module-power-system/fuel-cells) were unable to function without the necessary oxygen supply. Additionally, [AC Bus 2](/command-module-power-system/dc-ac-busses) was lost, which powered vital telemetry sensors.

### Step 3: Mission Control Debugging

The [mission control team](/apollo-13-accident/debugging-by-mission-control), led by Flight Director Gene Kranz and EECOM Sy Liebergot, worked tirelessly to diagnose the issues and develop a plan to bring the astronauts home safely. They faced numerous challenges, including limited power, dwindling oxygen supplies, and the need to navigate the spacecraft with minimal systems.

The Apollo 13 accident showcased the importance of the mission control team's expertise, teamwork, and ability to think creatively under pressure. Their efforts, combined with the astronauts' resilience and skill, ultimately led to a successful, albeit harrowing, return to Earth.

The Apollo 13 mission is often referred to as a "successful failure" due to the fact that, despite the accident, the crew was able to return safely to Earth thanks to the hard work and ingenuity of the mission control team and the astronauts themselves.
