# Inverter Contamination

Upon opening the Apollo Command Module inverter, the team discovered that the unit had been contaminated with hazardous materials, likely added by a previous owner. The presence of these substances made it unsafe to work on the inverter and posed potential health risks to the team.

## Discovery of Vermiculite

One of the most concerning findings was the presence of vermiculite inside the inverter. Vermiculite is a lightweight, insulating material that is often used for thermal insulation. However, it is also known to be laced with the most deadly form of asbestos, making it extremely toxic.

Vermiculite is a hazardous material that should be handled with extreme caution. Exposure to asbestos-contaminated vermiculite can lead to severe health issues, including lung cancer and mesothelioma.

The team speculated that the previous owner of the inverter might have thought it would be a good idea to fill the unit with vermiculite, possibly to improve its insulation properties. However, this decision was misguided, as vermiculite is not only toxic but also an incredibly good thermal insulator, making it one of the worst materials to use inside a power supply.

## Safety Precautions

Upon discovering the contamination, the team immediately took safety precautions to minimize the risk of exposure:

<Steps>
### Step 1

The team put on N95 masks to reduce the risk of inhaling any asbestos fibers or other hazardous particles.

### Step 2

They sealed the inverter in plastic bags to contain any loose particles and prevent further contamination of the workspace.

### Step 3

The team decided not to work on the inverter any further due to the high risk of exposure to hazardous materials.
</Steps>

## Impact on the Project

The discovery of the contamination had a significant impact on the project:

- The team could not proceed with the planned repairs and testing of the inverter due to the health risks involved.
- They had to take a few days off to thoroughly clean every surface in the lab to ensure a safe working environment.
- The inverter was sealed and set aside, with no plans to power it up or work on it in the future.

Despite the setback caused by the contamination, the team still gained valuable insights into the [Apollo Command Module Power System](/command-module-power-system) and the [Apollo 13 Accident](/apollo-13-accident) through their examination of the inverter and the associated documentation.
