# Apollo Command Module Power System

The Apollo Command Module's electrical system was a complex network of components designed to provide reliable power to the spacecraft throughout its mission. At the heart of this system were the fuel cells, which generated electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen. The power generated by the fuel cells was then distributed through a series of DC and AC busses to various systems and equipment on board the spacecraft.

The three main components of the Apollo Command Module's power system were:

1. [Fuel Cells](/command-module-power-system/fuel-cells): These were the primary power source for the spacecraft, generating electricity through a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen.

2. [DC and AC Busses](/command-module-power-system/dc-ac-busses): The power distribution network consisted of Main DC Bus A, Main DC Bus B, AC Bus 1, and AC Bus 2, which delivered power to various systems and equipment.

3. [Inverters](/command-module-power-system/inverters): Three inverters were responsible for converting DC power from the fuel cells to AC power for the spacecraft's systems that required it.

The Apollo Command Module's power system was designed with redundancy in mind, ensuring that the spacecraft could continue to function even if one or more components failed.

The power system's design allowed for flexibility in managing power distribution during normal operations and emergency situations. This flexibility proved crucial during the Apollo 13 mission, when the spacecraft experienced a critical failure in its oxygen tank, leading to a loss of power from two of the three fuel cells.

The diagram above illustrates the basic flow of power in the Apollo Command Module's electrical system. The fuel cells generate DC power, which is then distributed through the DC busses. The inverters convert the DC power to AC power, which is then distributed through the AC busses to the various systems and equipment that require it.

In the following sections, we will explore each of these components in greater detail, providing a comprehensive understanding of how the Apollo Command Module's power system functioned and how it was designed to handle the rigors of spaceflight.
