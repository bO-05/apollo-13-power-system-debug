# Introduction

The Apollo 13 mission, launched on April 11, 1970, is one of the most dramatic examples of crisis management and problem-solving in the history of spaceflight. The mission, intended to be the third lunar landing, was aborted due to a catastrophic failure in the spacecraft's power system. The video we'll be discussing delves into the intricate details of the Apollo 13 accident, focusing on the real-time debugging of the spacecraft's power system by the mission control team.

By examining an actual Apollo Command Module inverter and analyzing the original schematics, the video provides a comprehensive understanding of the electrical system's design and the critical decisions made by the ground crew to save the mission. This documentation will guide you through the following topics:

- [Apollo Command Module Power System](/command-module-power-system): An overview of the spacecraft's electrical system, including fuel cells, DC and AC busses, and inverters.
- [The Apollo 13 Accident](/apollo-13-accident): A detailed account of the events leading to the accident and the immediate aftermath.
- [Examining an Apollo Command Module Inverter](/examining-command-module-inverter): A hands-on examination of an actual inverter, discussing its design, components, and potential issues.
